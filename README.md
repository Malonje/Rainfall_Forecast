Benchmark Models for Prediction Interval Construction
Prediction Intervals (PI) are used to quantify the uncertainty associated with regression outputs. The methodologies construct PIs as a measure of the uncertainty. The
commonly used benchmarks for NN based PI constructions are the Delta methods, Nix and Weigend’s Mean Variance Estimator (MVE) and the
Bootstrap methods. Essentially these methodologies first obtain a prediction by minimizing a prediction-based loss function (e.g. mean squared
loss) and then apply statistical methodologies to obtain the PIs from the prediction.
