Benchmark Models for Prediction Interval Construction 

Prediction Intervals (PI) are used to quantify the uncertainty associated with regression outputs. The methodologies construct PIs as a measure of the uncertainty. The
commonly used benchmarks for NN based PI constructions are the Delta methods, Nix and Weigendâ€™s Mean Variance Estimator (MVE) and the
Bootstrap methods. Essentially these methodologies first obtain a prediction by minimizing a prediction-based loss function (e.g. mean squared
loss) and then apply statistical methodologies to obtain the PIs from the prediction.
